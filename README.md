A mobile app for novel site [ScribbleHub](https://www.scribblehub.com/) using Flutter.

Unofficial - I'm developing this app just for fun. Since it gets data from ScribbleHub through scraping, it might stop working unexpectedly.

## Implemented stuff
- Trending and latest novels
- Novel page
- Library, reading progress
- Search (basic)
- Reader (with basic formatting)
- Light and dark modes
- Reader font settings
